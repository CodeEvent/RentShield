# Idempotently seeds realistic (fictitious) RentShield notices and
# tenancy contracts so a new user -- or a prospective one clicking
# through the self-guided tour -- sees a platform that already has data
# in it, not an empty shell. Every document is created through the same
# real code paths the app itself uses (documents.rentshield.service, the
# stock paperless-ngx consumption pipeline) -- there is no seed-only
# shortcut that writes rows directly, so the demo data exercises exactly
# what a real notice/contract upload exercises, including the Workflow
# engine's DOCUMENT_ADDED triggers.
