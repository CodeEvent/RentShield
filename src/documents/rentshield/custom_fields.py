# Every RentShield notice is a real paperless-ngx Document — there is no
# separate rentshield database table. Structured notice fields (landlord,
# tenant, reason, e-sign status, ...) live as paperless-ngx CustomField
# values on that Document, and every generated notice carries the
# RENTSHIELD_TAG_NAME tag so the Angular frontend can list them with
# paperless's own stock GET /api/documents/?tags__id__in=<tag_id> — no
# rentshield-specific list endpoint needed either.
#
# The CustomField definitions themselves are bootstrapped by the data
# migration documents/migrations/0026_rentshield_custom_fields.py, which
# imports CUSTOM_FIELD_DEFS from this module (single source of truth for
# the field list); this module is also imported at request time by
# documents/rentshield_views.py to map field name -> id.

# a tag plus an email a human acts on manually, not an API integration
# (no UAE notary exposes one -- see documents/rentshield/notary_research/)
# and not a login role (see README's "Roles simplified" section for why
# a dedicated role/object-permission-grant machinery was cut). The human
# here is a real notary-services contact who processes these exactly as
# she did before this existed -- reads the notice, does the actual
# physical notarization herself, then comes back and records the result
# using paperless-ngx's OWN document editor: uploads the scanned/stamped
# copy as a normal Document, links it via the "Notarized Copy" field
# below, fills in the reference number, and swaps this tag for
# NOTARY_PUBLIC_COMPLETED_TAG_NAME/NOTARY_PUBLIC_REJECTED_TAG_NAME
# herself -- no bespoke completion UI or endpoint, same reasoning
# roles.py gives for keeping this off the object-permission-grant path
# that already caused this project's worst bugs once.

# Business logic (2026-09-11): a notary-public visit is itself one of
# the three legally recognized ways to serve a Dubai tenancy notice on
# a tenant under Article 25(3) (documents/rentshield/service_methods.py)
# -- so her marking "Notary Public Status" completed isn't just "the
# document got stamped," it's the actual legal service event. documents/
# rentshield/signals.py watches for that exact transition (still through
# the same plain document editor, no new UI) and: stamps "RentShield:
# Served Date" automatically, and emails the landlord that their notice
# has been served (or, on rejection, that it wasn't, with her notes) --
# closing the loop that used to end in silence. See service.py's
# _notify_notice_served().
