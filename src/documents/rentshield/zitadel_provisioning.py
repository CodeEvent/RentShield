# ZITADEL migration Phase C (2026-09-22, see /home/giova/.claude/plans/
# synchronous-finding-storm.md) -- not wired into signup_verify_view yet
# (that's Phase F). Sibling to authelia_provisioning.py, but structurally
# simpler than it, for a reason confirmed live against the running
# instance rather than assumed: ZITADEL's v2 User API lets a human user
# be created with NO password at all (Password is one arm of a oneof,
# never required), and RegisterPasskey/VerifyPasskeyRegistration are
# authorized for any caller holding a valid bearer token for the target
# user_id -- not gated on that specific user's own session the way
# Authelia's file backend required. Confirmed live: the provisioner PAT
# (IAM_OWNER, see docker-compose.yml's zitadel-api.environment) can call
# RegisterPasskey directly for a user it just created, no password,
# firstfactor login, or elevation dance needed at all -- the entire
# reason authelia_provisioning.py exists (provision_authelia_user +
# bootstrap_authelia_session, ~180 lines) collapses to one user-creation
# call plus a role grant here.
#
# The PAT itself never reaches the browser -- it's read from the
# zitadel-bootstrap volume (docker-compose.yml's webserver.volumes) and
# used only for server-to-server calls. The passkey ceremony's two
# browser-facing steps (get creation options, submit the credential) are
# Phase D's job: the bridge page will call back into Django (this
# module) rather than ZITADEL directly, so the admin-level PAT is never
# exposed client-side -- mirrors the CORS pattern
# authelia/nginx/nginx.conf's own /api/ location already established for
# the same reason (My Profile's Security tab calling Authelia directly).
#
# Org/project IDs below are hardcoded to Phase B's already-created
# resources (RentShield Operations org, RentShield project) -- move to
# settings/env once Phase F's cutover makes this the live path; no
# point wiring configurability for a module nothing calls yet.

    2026-09-23, fixing a real bug caught live: PAPERLESS_SOCIAL_ACCOUNT_
    SYNC_GROUPS (paperless/signals.py's handle_social_account_updated)
    REPLACES a user's entire Django group set from the ZITADEL ID
    token's roles claim on every single login (`.groups.set(groups,
    clear=True)`). Before this fix, provision_zitadel_user only ever
    granted the ZITADEL-side role "Property Owner" -- an Organization's
    membership existed ONLY as a local Django group, with nothing in
    the token to tell the next login's sync to keep it. Confirmed live:
    a real org member's `Org: X` group vanished on their second login,
    silently breaking the dashboard/team-roster/document-sharing
    features, all of which are defined purely as "whichever
    Organization.group the user is currently in."

    The fix makes an Organization's membership round-trip through
    ZITADEL like Property Owner/Notary Public already do: a Project
    Role named EXACTLY after the Organization's Group (the sync matches
    by exact Group.name, see handle_social_account_updated), granted
    alongside the ordinary role(s) below, so it survives every future
    re-sync instead of only existing until the next login.

    shared "RentShield" project lives under the root org and each
    Organization's own users only ever get cross-org grants against it
