    """One property owner's passport/ID verification via a self-hosted
    Idswyft instance (documents/rentshield_identity/idswyft_client.py) --
    camera capture + liveness + face match against the document photo,
    not NFC chip reading (see that file's header comment for why: NFC
    needs a native app or a PC/SC reader, neither of which this web app
    has). One row per user, created the first time they start
    verification; `status` is updated either by polling Idswyft's status
    endpoint or by its webhook, whichever lands first.

    `passport_photo`/`selfie_photo` are RentShield's own copies of what
    the user uploaded (saved before forwarding to Idswyft) -- Idswyft
    never returns these once processed, and the admin review page
    (rentshield_identity/admin_views.py) needs something to actually
    show a reviewer. Idswyft's own IDs/session tokens stay in
    `verification_id`, unrelated to Django storage.

    Full pipeline (2026-09-13): photograph the card -> Idswyft OCRs it
    (card_ocr_*) and RentShield auto-updates the user's first/last name
    from that -> NFC chip read (chip_*) cross-checked against the OCR
    fields -> selfie face-match against the card photo -> a short
    recorded video -> a human (Notary Public role) reviews everything
    and is the one who actually sets `status` to VERIFIED. Idswyft's own
    automated result (`automated_result`) only ever short-circuits to
    FAILED on a hard reject -- anything else reaches the Notary queue,
    per this project's explicit choice to keep human review as the
