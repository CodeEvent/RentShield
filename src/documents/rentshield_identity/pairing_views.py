# scanning a QR code shown on identity-verification.component.ts,

# reasoning; the short version is: the code has 192 bits of entropy, is
# single-use, and expires in PAIRING_CODE_TTL, so pair_claim_view can
# safely be AllowAny (the phone has no account yet at that point) --
# claiming one only ever grants the same DRF auth Token a normal
