# Dubai Rent Shield

A bilingual (English / Legal Arabic) statutory tenancy-notice platform for
Dubai landlords, property managers, and agents — generates RERA-compliant
12-month eviction notices (Law No. 33 of 2008, Article 25(2)) and 30-day
lease-breach notices (Article 25(1)).

## Repo layout

This repo is structured after [minthcm](https://github.com/minthcm/minthcm)'s
module conventions (`api/`, `vue/`, `mcp/`, `docker/`, `install/`) — **as an
architectural reference only**. MintHCM itself is an AGPL-3.0-licensed HR
platform with no eviction/tenancy domain logic; none of its code, modules,
or license carry over here. Everything in `api/`, `vue/`, `mcp/`, `ocr/`, and
`shared/` is original to this project.

```
shared/     Single source of truth for the legal logic: statutory reasons,
            RERA date math (365-day / 30-day), the bilingual notice
            templates, and the compliance-clause checker. Imported by api/,
            vue/, and mcp/ as a workspace package (@rentshield/shared) so
            the legal text, date rules, and clause detection can never
            drift between the three.

api/        Express + Node's built-in SQLite (node:sqlite — no external
            database to install). CRUD for saved notices (re-renders the
            bilingual document from shared/ on every read), and a
            /api/documents/analyze route that forwards an upload to ocr/
            and runs shared/'s compliance checker on the result.

vue/        Vue 3 + Vite + Pinia + Tailwind v4 + Vue Router. A dashboard-
            platform shell (collapsible sidebar navigation, top bar) around
            the wizard + live bilingual preview, ported from the original
            single-file prototype (legacy/index.html) onto this real
            frontend.

mcp/        A real MCP (Model Context Protocol) server — calculate_notice_
            expiry, draft_eviction_notice, list_statutory_reasons — the
            actual integration point the prototype's chat panel only
            simulated locally. Any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code)
            can attach to it over stdio.

ocr/        A Python/FastAPI service running PaddleOCR's PP-OCRv4 models
            (github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) via RapidOCR's ONNX export
            (github.com/RapidAI/RapidOCR) — turns an uploaded tenancy
            addendum (image, PDF, or .txt export) into text for api/'s
            compliance checker to scan. The only non-Node service, so it
            isn't an npm workspace; see "Running it locally" below.

docker/     Dockerfiles + compose for the ocr, api, and vue services.

install/    seed.js — seeds the local SQLite database with example notices.

legacy/     The original single-file HTML/CSS/JS prototype this platform
            was rebuilt from. Kept for reference; not part of the build.
```

## Running it locally

```bash
npm install                 # installs all Node workspaces (shared/api/vue/mcp)
npm run seed                # optional: seed example notices

# ocr/ is Python, not an npm workspace — set up its venv once:
python3 -m venv ocr/.venv
source ocr/.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ocr/requirements.txt
deactivate

source ocr/.venv/bin/activate && npm run dev:ocr   # http://localhost:8001
npm run dev:api                                     # http://localhost:4000
npm run dev:vue                                     # http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api -> :4000)
```

The chat drawer's document upload works without `ocr/` running for `.txt`
uploads (no OCR needed) but needs it for images/PDFs — the API returns a
clear "OCR service unavailable" error otherwise rather than hanging. The
OCR models ship inside the `rapidocr-onnxruntime` pip package itself (no
external download at all, from any host), so the very first request is
only slightly slower than the rest (constructing the ONNX runtime
session), not a multi-second model fetch.

To run the MCP server standalone (e.g. to attach it to Claude Desktop):

```bash
npm run dev:mcp
```

Or with Docker (builds all three services, `ocr` included):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

### Sharing a click-through UI preview (no backend required)

Because this is now a real multi-service app, there's no single file to
just send someone anymore — seeing it live normally means running `api/`
and `vue/` (and `ocr/` for the chat's document upload) yourself. For
sharing the UI itself without any of that:

```bash
cd vue
npm run build:preview     # -> dist-preview/index.html (self-contained,
                           #    JS + CSS inlined, one file)
```

This is a separate build path (`vite.preview.config.js` +
`vite-plugin-singlefile`), not the real deployment (`docker/web.Dockerfile`
still builds the normal multi-file bundle for that). Every backend-
dependent feature — saving a notice, the chat's document upload, the
saved-notices list, the Settings API health check — fails exactly as
gracefully in this build as when the real `api/` is simply offline; none
of it is mocked. `npm run build:preview` also runs
`scripts/strip-html-shell.js`, which produces `dist-preview/content-only.html`
— the page content with the `<!doctype>/<html>/<head>/<body>` wrapper
tags removed, for pasting into a tool that supplies its own document
skeleton (e.g. an Artifact-hosting service). Publish `dist-preview/index.html`
directly instead if the destination wants a complete, self-contained page.

## What's ported from the prototype vs. not yet

**Ported to the new architecture:** the 4-step wizard, the full bilingual
(EN/AR) document for both notice types, the 365-day/30-day date engine, the
reason-specific compliance warnings, the pre-payment blur, real persistence
via the API, the RentShield AI chat drawer (conversational intake, off-topic
refusal, drag-and-drop document upload — now backed by **real OCR**, see
below), and the simulated Stripe-style paywall modal (fake card form →
processing → success → unblur → print).

The chat drawer is still a local simulation, same as the prototype — no
network calls, no API key in the browser. `mcp/server.js` is the real
integration point for wiring it to an actual hosted model later: its tool
descriptions (Dubai-only focus, hedged legal language, the 12-month vs
30-day distinction) are written to match what the simulated chat already
does, so swapping the simulation for real tool calls shouldn't change the
UX contract.

The mobile/PWA polish is ported too: `viewport-fit=cover` + safe-area
insets on the header, the chat toggle button, and the chat input bar, the
16px-on-mobile fix for form inputs (prevents iOS Safari's zoom-on-focus),
`format-detection` so Ejari/plot numbers don't become tap-to-call links,
an inline SVG favicon/apple-touch-icon, and a runtime-generated Web App
Manifest (`vue/src/pwa.js`, a Blob URL — no static manifest file needed)
so "Add to Home Screen" launches it standalone on both iOS and Android.

At this point everything from `legacy/index.html` has a counterpart in the
new architecture except payment, which is still fully simulated (no real
Stripe integration) — true of the original prototype too, not a regression.

## Real OCR (ocr/, replacing the scripted response)

The prototype's document-analysis card always said the same thing — "found
a clause stating 60 days notice" — no matter what was actually uploaded.
That's now a real pipeline:

```
Vue (ChatDrawer.vue)
  → POST /api/documents/analyze (multipart file)
api/ (documents.js)
  → POST ocr:8001/extract (forwards the file)
ocr/ (main.py, RapidOCR running PaddleOCR's PP-OCRv4 models)
  → extracts text: OCR for images, page-by-page rasterize+OCR for PDFs
    (via pypdfium2), direct read for .txt
api/ (documents.js)
  → shared/complianceCheck.js scans the extracted text for
    "<N> days notice" clauses under the 365-day statutory minimum,
    and for an Ejari number
  → returns { ocr, analysis } to Vue
Vue (ChatDrawer.vue)
  → renders the actual findings (or "nothing suspicious found" if
    clean) and auto-fills Ejari only if the OCR text actually had one
```

**This is genuinely verified end-to-end**, not just written and hoped for
— including the image/PDF path, not only `.txt`. The original plan used
the `paddleocr` pip package directly, whose first-use model download
reaches HuggingFace/ModelScope/BOS; every one of those hosts turned out to
be blocked by this project's own dev sandbox, so that path couldn't be
exercised for real. The fix: `ocr/` runs the identical PP-OCRv4
detection/recognition models via **RapidOCR**
(github.com/RapidAI/RapidOCR), an ONNX export of PaddleOCR's own models
maintained specifically for easier deployment — the model files ship
inside the `rapidocr-onnxruntime` pip wheel itself, so there is no
external download at all, from any host, ever. That unblocked full
verification:

- A real PDF, rendered to an image and OCR'd, correctly extracted
  "Landlord may terminate with 60 days notice" and "Ejari Certificate No:
  1234567890" — the API's compliance checker correctly flagged the 60-day
  clause, and driving the actual Vue app in a browser confirmed the alert
  rendering in the chat and `1234567890` landing in the wizard's real
  Ejari input field (not a hardcoded placeholder).
- A clean document with a 365-day clause correctly produces no alert.
- **A real, honest limitation surfaced by this testing, not hidden**: on
  a lower-quality test image, OCR misread "60" as "6o" (a genuine
  character-confusion artifact on noisy input), and the compliance
  regex — which requires actual digits — missed that clause as a result.
  The higher-quality PDF read the same text correctly. This means OCR
  accuracy on a blurry phone photo is a real limiting factor for the
  compliance check, not just a theoretical one — worth knowing before
  relying on it for anything high-stakes.

`analyzeTenancyText` is deliberately simple regex matching, not a
language model — it catches the literal pattern "&lt;number&gt; days
notice" and nothing worded differently, or misread by OCR. A clean scan
is a real signal, not proof the document has no other issues.

## App shell (dashboard-platform layout)

The prototype was a single-page tool; the Vue app is now a routed
dashboard-platform shell, matching MintHCM's UI pattern (sidebar nav + top
bar + module switcher) rather than just its folder structure:

```
vue/src/components/shell/
  Sidebar.vue   Dark sidebar, module nav (Dashboard / New Notice / Saved
                Notices / Settings) driven by router.js's route meta, plus
                an "AI Assistant" entry that opens the chat drawer. Slides
                in as an overlay under the lg: breakpoint; at lg: and above
                it's collapsible to an icon rail (a "Collapse" toggle at
                the bottom), remembered per browser via localStorage.
  TopBar.vue    Page title (from route meta), a "New Notice" quick action,
                and a mobile hamburger to open the sidebar.

vue/src/views/
  DashboardView.vue      Real stat tiles (total / 12-month / 30-day /
                          AI-reviewed — computed from saved notices, not
                          fake numbers) + a recent-notices panel.
  NoticeBuilderView.vue  The wizard + live preview (what used to be the
                          whole app) at /notices/new.
  NoticesListView.vue    Every saved notice as a table, at /notices.
  SettingsView.vue       Live API health check, service charges, default
                          add-ons, and app info.
```

`App.vue` is now just the shell (`Sidebar` + `TopBar` + `<router-view>`)
with `ChatDrawer` and `PaymentModal` mounted globally so they overlay
whichever page is active, exactly as before.

**Known limitation:** the production Docker build serves `vue/` as a static
bundle, which doesn't proxy `/api/*` the way the Vite dev server does — a
production deployment needs a reverse proxy or a configurable API base URL
before `docker compose up` is a real one-command deploy.

The router uses hash history (`/#/notices/new`, not `/notices/new`)
deliberately — it needs no server-side SPA-rewrite rule to serve a deep
link or survive a refresh, which matters for a static bundle (Docker,
`vue/dist` opened directly, or a single-file preview build).

## Pricing (shared/pricing.js)

A base generator fee plus optional add-on services, priced and selected
individually — a checkbox cart, not a flat two-tier toggle. Modeled on how
jurist.ae's Tenant Eviction Notice product structures its checkout (a base
price plus add-ons like Apostille, MOFA Attestation, and Express Service),
but priced for what this platform actually is — an instant self-serve
generator — not what Jurist is selling: a human-lawyer-drafted, physically
notarized, ID-verified, courier-served document for 3,950 AED base plus
hundreds-to-thousands in add-ons. This platform doesn't perform that labor,
so it isn't priced like it does.

```
Bilingual Notice Generator ............ 95 AED   (base — always included)
+ Add Notarization Service ........... 249 AED   (add-on)
+ Add AI Compliance Review ............ 99 AED   (add-on — auto-selected
                                                   when the chat's document
                                                   upload finds something)
```

`shared/pricing.js` is the single source of truth (`BASE_PRICE_AED`,
`ADD_ONS`, `calculateTotal()`) — imported by the Pinia store for the
add-ons checklist and payment-modal breakdown, and by `api/` for
`GET /api/pricing` and for computing `totalPriceAed` on every saved
notice. `add_notarization` and `add_ai_review` are separate boolean
columns on the `notices` table (replacing the old single `tier` column).

## Open-source legal-tech integrations

Three integrations evaluated from a set of open-source legal-tech
repositories, each addressing a gap this project had already identified
in itself.

### Real notarization: DocuSeal + OpenSign (`api/src/services/esign/`)

The "Notarization Service" add-on used to just charge 249 AED and do
nothing. It now routes the generated notice through a real self-hosted
e-signature engine — [DocuSeal](https://github.com/docusealco/docuseal)
as primary, [OpenSign](https://github.com/opensignlabs/OpenSign) as
automatic fallback if DocuSeal is unreachable — rather than picking one.
`docusealClient.js` and `opensignClient.js` call each project's real REST
API (DocuSeal's `/api/submissions/html`; OpenSign's Parse-Server-based
`createdocumentfromapp` Cloud Function and `contracts_Contactbook`
pointer class) — endpoint shapes were read directly out of both projects'
own source (`docs/openapi.json`, `docs/api/nodejs.md`, and
`cloud/parsefunction/*.js` respectively), not guessed. `renderPdf.js`
adds real server-side PDF rendering via Playwright/Chromium (the browser
previously only had `window.print()`) for OpenSign, which signs an
uploaded file rather than accepting raw HTML the way DocuSeal does.

Verified against mock HTTP servers shaped exactly like each real API
(request formatting and response parsing both checked), and the
orchestrator's primary-fails → fallback-succeeds path was verified
end-to-end including a real Playwright PDF render. Not verified against
a live DocuSeal/OpenSign deployment — this sandbox has no Docker
daemon — so `docker/docker-compose.yml` ships both as real services
(official images) for anyone standing this up for real; unreachable
providers degrade gracefully (502 with both providers' actual error
messages, same pattern as `ocr/`'s failure handling) rather than
silently.

### Wider legal guidance: a skills library (`mcp/skills/`)

Inspired by two skill libraries evaluated for this platform —
[ThomasMoreAI/legal-skills-open](https://github.com/ThomasMoreAI/legal-skills-open)
and [zgbrenner/agentcounsel](https://github.com/zgbrenner/agentcounsel) —
`mcp/skills/*.md` adds a small library of reference guidance (Markdown +
YAML frontmatter, explicit human-review disclaimers) covering questions
adjacent to notice drafting: filing at the RDSC, security deposit
disputes, and which notice-service methods Article 25(3) actually
recognizes. The content is written for this platform (no file-level
access to either repo's exact skill text was available), but the
"small, disclaimed, reviewable skill" shape and safety framing
deliberately mirror both.

`mcp/src/server.js` exposes `list_legal_skills` / `get_legal_skill`
(browsable, like both source projects) plus
`check_notice_service_method_validity`, an interactive tool built on the
service-method skill's content — verified via a real MCP
`Client`/`StdioClientTransport` round trip. `api/src/routes/legalSkills.js`
reads the same `mcp/skills/` directory (no content duplication) so
`ChatDrawer.vue` can answer these questions in-app via regex keyword
routing — consistent with how the rest of that chat drawer already
works, not an NLP claim. Verified in a live browser session against the
running dev servers.

### Deeper document analysis: a citation graph (`shared/citationGraph.js`)

[Open-Source-Legal/OpenContracts](https://github.com/Open-Source-Legal/OpenContracts)
treats a document corpus as a traversable graph — clauses and the legal
provisions they cite, as nodes and edges — via its own Django + GraphQL +
Celery + Docling service. This project doesn't run that stack, so
`buildCitationGraph()` implements the same *idea* natively, in plain JS:
it scans uploaded document text for notice-period clauses and
service-method mentions, and links each one as a graph edge to the
specific Article 25 provision it satisfies or violates — instead of the
single flat regex `complianceCheck.js` had before. Every legal citation
it uses (Article 25(1)/(2)/(3)) was already established and
cross-checked elsewhere in this codebase (`shared/reasons.js`, the
`notice-service-method-uae` skill); nothing new about UAE law is
asserted here. `shared/serviceMethods.js` is the single source of truth
for recognized/unrecognized service methods, shared by this graph, the
MCP tool, and the skill file.

Same honesty caveat as the rest of this project's text analysis: a
citation it draws is a real signal, not proof the document has no other
issues when it draws none. `api/src/routes/documents.js` returns it
alongside the existing `analysis` on every `/analyze` call, and
`ChatDrawer.vue` renders it as a flat "citation graph" list under the
existing compliance findings — verified end-to-end with both a violating
and a fully compliant sample document, and in a live browser session.

### What wasn't integrated, and why

- **openarsenalspecs/Legal** — AGPL-3.0+, 0 stars/forks, 95 commits,
  mostly specification documents rather than working software, and about
  AI-governance frameworks generally rather than tenancy law. Not a fit.
- **opensource.legal/directory** and **contracts.opensource.legal** — both
  blocked by this sandbox's network egress policy (same domain), so their
  contents were never verified directly; treated as a links directory,
  not something to integrate.
